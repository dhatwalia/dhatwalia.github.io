            Their goal is to save lives, find new cures and provide world-className care. They are also fighting against the limits of a 70-year-old hospital where parts of the building dont meet modern building codes. Their most vulnerable patients are crammed into overcrowded rooms. Their our outdated spaces cant accommodate the weight of an MRI machine. Thats why they are trying to raise $1.5 billion dollars in donations. They need you on our side in the SickKids VS Limits Campaign, the biggest fundraising campaign in Canadian health-care history, to help build a brand-new hospital.
